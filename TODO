isaacsim omni.isaac.sim.kit

Implementation:
- possibly use curriculum manager instead of curriculum wrapper

Hyperparameters:
- (rl_games) network/separate: try True (seperate actor and critic networks; supposedly works better for continuous control)
- (rl_games) config/normalize_input: try True (normalize observations)
- (rl_games) env/clip_observations: check if current value (5.0) is good

Experiments:
- algorithms: PPO / SAC
- curricula: 
    - distance ball opponent goal -> + goal scored/conceded -> + time to goal scored
    - distance ball opponent goal + player in goal -> + goal scored/conceded -> + time to goal scored
    - collision player ball -> distance ball opponent goal -> + goal scored/conceded
- opponents: random / self-play current policy / self-play multiple checkpoints
- resets: only timeout / goal scored/conceded, player in goal, timeout

Performance:
- sbx: 22k fps
- sb3: 23k fps
- rl_games: 60k fps
