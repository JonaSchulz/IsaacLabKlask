Experiments:
- algorithms: PPO / SAC
- curricula: 
    - distance ball opponent goal -> + goal scored/conceded -> + time to goal scored
    - distance ball opponent goal + player in goal -> + goal scored/conceded -> + time to goal scored
    - collision player ball -> distance ball opponent goal -> + goal scored/conceded
- opponents: random / self-play current policy / self-play multiple checkpoints
- resets: only timeout / goal scored/conceded, player in goal, timeout

SAC, self-play
